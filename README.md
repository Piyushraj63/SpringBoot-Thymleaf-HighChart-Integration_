# SpringBoot-Thymleaf-HighChart-Integration_



Hii This is Piyushraj Singh

In this, I have Integrated Highchart with spring boot in a simple mannner.
In src/main/resources/static/Highchart folder contains Highchart css and js.
In src/main/resources/templates/examples folder contains all Highchart templates.
So if you want to use that template, just go in HChartController.java and change the return type.
